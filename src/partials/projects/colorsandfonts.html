      Colors & fonts was my very first project and I was supposed to make a
      simple landing page with some gradients, but then scaled quickly during
      development and I ended up including fonts too. You can copy paste
      gradient, color palette, glyphs, font pairings and this year ( 2021 ) I
      included a color system The product is very popular within the design and
      development community, it has appeard on yotube videos by known youtubers
      and it has around 6k monthly users.
